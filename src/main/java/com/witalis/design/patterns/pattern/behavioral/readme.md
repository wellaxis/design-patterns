`Behavioral` patterns
> **Behavioral design patterns** - to identify common communication patterns among objects.
> By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.

|   1 |                 [Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern)                 | Represent an operation to be performed on instances of a set of classes. Visitor lets a new operation be defined without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.                                |       [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/visitor/Visitor.java)       |
|   2 |                [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern)                | Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.                                                       |      [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/strategy/Strategy.java)      |
|   3 |                   [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern)                   | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.                                                                                                 |         [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/state/State.java)         |
|   4 |                 [Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern)                 | Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parameterization of clients with different requests, and the queuing or logging of requests.                                                          |       [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/command/Command.java)       |
|   5 |                 [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern)                 | Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.                                                                        |       [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/memento/Memento.java)       |
|   6 |                [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)                | Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.                                                         |      [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/observer/Observer.java)      |
|   7 |                [Mediator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern)                | Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly (it allows their independent interaction).           |      [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/mediator/Mediator.java)      |
|   8 |                [Iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern)                | Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.                                                                                           |      [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/iterator/Iterator.java)      |
|   9 |             [Iterpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern)              | Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.                                                           |   [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/interpreter/Interpreter.java)   |
|  10 |         [Template Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern)         | Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.        |   [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/template/TemplateMethod.java)   |
|  11 | [Chain of Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern) | Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. |  [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/chain/ChainResponsibility.java)  |
|  12 |             [Null Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern)             | Avoid null references by providing a default object.                                                                                                                                                               |      [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/nulls/NullObject.java)       |
|  13 |           [Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern)           | Recombinable business logic in a Boolean fashion.                                                                                                                                                                  | [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/specification/Specification.java) |
|  14 |            [Servant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_(design_pattern))             | Define common functionality for a group of classes. The servant pattern is also frequently called helper class or utility class implementation for a given set of classes.                                         |       [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/servant/Servant.java)       |
|  15 |         [Blackboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_(design_pattern))          | Provide a computational framework for the design and implementation of systems that integrate large and diverse specialized modules, and implement complex, non-deterministic control strategies.                  |    [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/behavioral/blackboard/Blackboard.java)    |
