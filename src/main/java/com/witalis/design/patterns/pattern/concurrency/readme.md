|   1 |               [Active Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object)               | Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests. |
|   2 |             [Balking pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balking_pattern)             | Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.                                                                                                                                      |
|   3 |           [Barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_(computer_science))            | A barrier for a group of threads or processes in the source code means any thread/process must stop at this point and cannot proceed until all other threads/processes reach this barrier.                         |
|   4 |      [Double-checked locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking)      | Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual locking logic proceed.                                 |
|   5 |          [Guarded suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_suspension)          | Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.                                                                                |
|   6 |        [Monitor Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization))         | An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.                                                                      |
|   7 |                 [Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern)                 | A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously.                                                                                                               |
|   8 |       [Read-write lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writer_lock)       | Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for write operations. An underlying semaphore might be used for writing, and a Copy-on-write mechanism may or may not be used.           |
|   9 |            [Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing))             | Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.                                                                                                                                                  |
|  10 |                 [Thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool)                 | A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads.                                                           |
|  11 |        [Thread-local storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage)        | A computer programming method that uses static or global memory local to a thread (TLS).                                                                                                                           |
|  12 |                    [Join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-pattern)                    | Join-pattern provides a way to write concurrent, parallel and distributed programs by message passing. Compared to the use of threads and locks, this is a high-level programming model.                           |
|  13 |              [Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science))               | One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it.                                                                                                                   |
|  14 |               [Messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_pattern)               | Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications.                                                                                                                         |
|  15 | [Event-based asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_method_invocation) | Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs.                                                                                                                             |
