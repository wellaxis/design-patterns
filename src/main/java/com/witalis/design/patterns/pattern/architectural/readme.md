## Architectural Design Patterns
***

`Architectural` patterns
> **Architectural design patterns** - reusable solutions to a commonly occurring problems
> in software architecture within a given context. The architectural patterns address
> various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations,
> high availability and minimization of a business risk.
> Some architectural patterns have been implemented within software frameworks.

|   1 |     [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)     | A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).                         |
|   2 |              [Layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_(object-oriented_design))              | A layer is a group of classes that have the same set of link-time module dependencies to other modules. In other words, a layer is a group of reusable components that are reusable in similar circumstances.                                          |
|   3 |                      [Broker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker_pattern)                      | Can be used to structure distributed software systems with decoupled components that interact by remote procedure calls.                                                                                                                               |
|   4 |       [Event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)       | A software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.                                                                                                                                          |
|   5 | [Action–domain–responder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action%E2%80%93domain%E2%80%93responder) | A refinement of Model–view–controller (MVC) that is better suited for web applications. Different styles: MVC, PAC, MVP, MVVM, etc.                                                                                                                    |
|   6 |                   [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)                   | Arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.                                                                                     |
|   7 |    [Hexagonal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))     | It aims at creating loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and adapters. This makes components exchangeable at any level and facilitates test automation.                 |
|   8 |          [Multitier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture)          | A client–server architecture in which presentation, application processing and data management functions are physically separated. The most widespread use of multitier architecture is the three-tier architecture.                                   |
|   9 |   [Service-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)   | SOA is an architectural style that supports service orientation. It is as well applied in the field of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. |
|  10 |         [Entity component system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)         | An ECS follows the principle of composition over inheritance, meaning that every entity is defined not by a "type", but by the components that are associated with it.                                                                                 |
|  11 |                    [Peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)                    | P2P is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.                       |
|  12 |        [Pipe and filter architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software))         | A pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements (processes, threads, coroutines, functions, etc.), arranged so that the output of each element is the input of the next; the name is by analogy to a physical pipeline.                          |
|  13 |          [Distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)          | DHT is a distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table: key-value pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key.                                    |
|  14 |                   [Naked objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects)                   | All business logic should be encapsulated onto the domain objects. The user interface should be a direct representation of the domain objects. The UI shall be entirely automatically created from the definitions of the domain objects.              |
|  15 |          [Operational data store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_data_store)          | ODS is used for operational reporting and as a source of data for the enterprise data warehouse. It is a complementary element to an EDW in a decision support landscape, and is used for operational reporting, controls, etc.                        |
