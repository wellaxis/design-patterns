|   1 | [Simple Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)) | Using factories instead of constructors or prototypes allows to use polymorphism for object creation, not only object use. Specifically, using factories provides encapsulation. |   [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/factory/simple/SimpleFactory.java)    |
|   2 |        [Factory Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)         | Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.           |   [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/factory/method/FactoryMethod.java)    |
|   3 |      [Abstract Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)       | Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                                            | [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/factory/abstracts/AbstractFactory.java) |
|   4 |               [Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern)                | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.                                 |          [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/builder/Builder.java)          |
|   5 |             [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)              | Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.                                                                                                |        [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/singleton/Singleton.java)        |
|   6 |              [Multiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton_pattern)               | Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide a global point of access to them.                                                                                           |         [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/multiton/Multiton.java)         |
|   7 |             [Prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern)              | Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object.                                          |        [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/prototype/Prototype.java)        |
|   8 |       [Lazy Initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization)        | Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed.                                     |      [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/lazy/LazyInitialization.java)      |
|   9 |           [Object Pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern)            | Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use.                                                                             |          [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/pool/ObjectPool.java)          |
|  10 |      [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)       | A class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly.                                                                               |   [Java](/src/main/java/com/witalis/design/patterns/pattern/creational/injection/DependencyInjection.java)   |
